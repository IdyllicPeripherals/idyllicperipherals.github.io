## Demo content

This page is a demo that shows everything you can do inside portfolio and blog posts.

We've included everything you need to create engaging posts about your work, and show off your case studies in a beautiful way.

**Obviously,** we’ve styled up *all the basic* text formatting options [available in markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

You can create lists:

* Simple bulleted lists
* Like this one
* Are cool

And:

1. Numbered lists
2. Like this other one
3. Are great too

You can also add blockquotes, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:

> “Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”

The theme also supports markdown tables:

| Item                 | Author        | Supports tables? | Price |
|----------------------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Duet Jekyll Theme    | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |
| Index Jekyll Theme   | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |
| Journal Jekyll Theme | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |

And footnotes[^1], which link to explanations[^2] at the bottom of the page[^3].

[^1]: Beautiful modern, minimal theme design.
[^2]: Powerful features to show off your work.
[^3]: Maintained and supported by the theme developer.

You can throw in some horizontal rules too:

### Storage Container
An easy to open, easy to close, way to store all your tools. A container like this is a great way to stay organised while also keeping the dust, fibers and pet hair out. 

### Switch Opener
The Switch Opener will work with both MX and Wing-latch style switches.

	<img src="/images/Photo_Blog/Switch_Opener_MX.jpg">
</div>

Position the switch correctly, before gently pushing downwards.

### Silicone Oil - 1000cst
This locally-produced oil is for lubing the springs of your switches. Some prefer brushing it on directly, however, others also find it perfect for bag lubing. 
The thickness and high viscosity of this oil helps it stick to surfaces longer and does a better job at removing spring "ping" and "crunch" than thinner alternatives.

### Puller 2-in-1 
Use gentle a side to side motion when pulling off keycaps. This minimises potential damage to the underside of the plastic. 
The metal prongs are designer to make it easier for you to pull switches out of plates. Press and squeese the North and South of the switch, then pull upwards. 
You may need to also wiggle the East and West of the switch.

### Triangular Brush
Please wash and rinse the bristles of all brushes before use. 
Comfortable handle, slightly larger in size and has a bit more weight than the straight brushes. 
It's shape helps stop it from rolling away and it comes with useful little cap to protect the bristles from dust and damage when not in use.

### Stem Holder
A tool like this is perfect for holding switch Stem and makes lubing them so much easier. Press and hold the top open the clutch; release to grip. 
You no longer need to fear accidently dropping and searching for those loose stems.  
Dustproof and Regular MX Style are both compatiable with this Stem Holder.
