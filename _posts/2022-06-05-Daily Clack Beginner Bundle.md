### Silicone Oil - 1000cst
This locally-produced oil is for lubing the springs of your switches. 
Some prefer brushing it on directly, however, it is also perfect for bag lubing. Use a generous amount to make sure the spring is coated completely.

The thickness and high viscosity of this oil helps it stick to surfaces longer and does a better job at removing spring "ping" and "crunch" than thinner alternatives.

### 2-in-1 Puller
**Keycap Puller**
Use a gentle side to side motion when pulling off keycaps. This minimizes potential damage to the underside of the plastic. 

**Switch Puller** 
The metal prongs are designed to make it easier for you to pull switches out of plates. Press and squeeze the North and South of the switch, then pull upwards. 
You may need to also wiggle the East and West of the switch.

### Triangular Brush
**Please wash and rinse the bristles of all the brushes before use.**
This brush has a comfortable handle and is slightly larger in size than the straight brushes. 
Its shape also helps it not roll away when placed on a table. 

<div class="gallery" data-columns="2">

All brushes come with a useful little cap to protect the bristles from collecting dust when not in use.

### Stem Holder
A tool like this is perfect for holding switch Stems and makes lubing them so much easier. Press and hold the top open the clutch; release to grip. 

You no longer need to fear accidentally dropping and searching for those loose stems.
