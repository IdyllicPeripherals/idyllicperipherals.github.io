### Checklist and Notes

#### PCB
- Check Stabilizers are installed and are functioning. 
- Clip your switches into the plate and solder the switches into the PCB.

#### Acrylic Layers
- Have an adequate amount of working space. The more table space the better.
- Acrylic Layers can snap easily. Handle with care, and take your time peeling the protective film. 
- Build from the bottom-upwards (refer to below "Build Guide with Pictures"). 
- Donâ€™t start peeling and building the case till the PCB and Plate are soldered together. This minimizes the time for exposed acrylic to accumulate dust. 
- Do not wipe with isopropyl alcohol. This damages the acrylic and causes it to fracture. 
- Wiping down each layer of acrylic with a damp cloth is recommended to minimize dust and the risk of ElectroStatic Discharge (EST). 
- Some surfaces have protective film on both sides. Acrylic with brown-film only has protection on 1 side. 
- To make the peeling process easier, tweezers or a hobby blade are convenient to use. Sometimes sticky-tape can also be used to help pull film off.

### Build Guide with Pictures - Acrylic Risers and Bumpons

Unbuilt, the board is wobbly and unstable. However, this will quickly be fixed once we start building.

</div>

Apply the 4x larger bumpons onto the frosted acrylic. 
There are circles to help you locate where to apply them.

### Build Guide with Pictures - Plate and the PCB

Before we get to the case, I recommend starting with the basic keyboard stuff. i.e. soldering, lubing stabs, testing the PCB, ect.

Only the Acrylic needs to be peeled; the Polypropylene plate does not need peeling.

I prefer putting the switches into the plate first, before lowering it into the PCB.

If you are having difficulties with the plate, use the included support fork.

### Build Guide with Pictures - Main Case Teardown

Unscrew the case and begin to remove al the layers while keeping note of where each piece belongs in the stack.

### Build Guide with Pictures - Main Case Assembly 

We can begin to peel off the protective film once we reach the final layer.

Take your time peeling each layer; be considerate of dust and how you are handling the acrylic. 
If you are not careful the acrylic can snap and/or you could injure yourself on a sharp edge.

Add the M2 nuts into the hexagonal cutouts.

Grab your Plate and PCB; it's time to add it into the stack.
Connect the JST cable from the daughterboard to the PCB.

Screw the case back together; don't forget to install the remaining smaller bumpons on the underside of the case.
