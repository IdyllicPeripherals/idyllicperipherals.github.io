### Aesthetics
Initially I wanted my design to be a simple shape, flat without any “points and peaks”. However, for this design to happen, the second display ledge cannot be lower than where the first ledge ends. 

While this isn’t a problem on its own, it leads to some future predicaments for both me as the producer, and customers as the end-user. Ultimately, I decided to completely re-evaluate my approach and abandon the idea of a simple shaped double stand. 


### Practicality
**_What value does a double stand provide that two singular stands cannot?_**

I’m conscious some people detest the visuals of a double stand which hides the 2nd keyboard behind the 1st, however I feel visuals are worth sacrificing for the sake of practicality. 

Currently, an advantage of my Double Stand design is its small form-factor. I believe that a stand which can fit on as many shelves and display units as possible is an extremely important consideration. The “less desirable” aesthetics of the side-profile a worthwhile trade-off for better compatibility and a better user experience. My double stands have a depth of 20cm, which is as compact as I could get without too many compromises.

**_What's the value of a display piece that can't actually fit in the area you want to display it?_**

Anecdotally, the book shelves I’ve measured are between 20cm and 30cm in depth; for additional reference a vertical A4 sheet of paper is 21cm in width –  so I think it’s fair to assume around 21cm is a good reference point for a shelving unit. 

If I’m displaying my two of my beloved, >$1,000 keyboards on a shelving unit, an overhanging display stand is not an option, the display stand needs to be smaller than the display shelf. I do not want to be taking any risks because an accidental bump might happen.

**_How often will someone be looking at the side profile of the stand, shouldn’t focus be on the two beautiful keyboards on display?_**


### Affordability

For better or worse, I’m blessed with a pretty good Standard of Living here in Australia. Unfortunately, that also means the price of my goods will reflect that; given I am the one producing and packaging all in-house. 

Pricing involves multiple factors, however in its simplest, machine-processing time, material cost, and labour are major influencers. 

After a lot of experimenting and calculations, I can confirm that committing with my current small-form-factor Double Stand design, as opposed to a larger design, means: 

* Faster processing times on the laser machine 
* Uses less materials -> Less surface area -> Efficient nesting options
* Easier and quicker to handle + pack

All of which are extremely desirable because it means “a more affordable” product for the consumer. 
It’s completely understandable for a customer to hold little regard for the intangibles, and instead simply want X item to serve Y purpose at a low cost, which is why I’ve tried my best to optimise wherever possible.
