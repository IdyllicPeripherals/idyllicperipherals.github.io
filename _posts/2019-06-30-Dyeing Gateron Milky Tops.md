## A Unique and Custom Aesthetic Change 

I’ve had success dyeing Gateron Milky Tops; I’m assuming Gazzew’s new Outemu range could probably accept dyes as well. 

Clear PC tops and Black Cherry tops don’t change their colour when heated in a dye solution.  

I simply added a small amount of dye solution into a metal pan and brought it to boil before adding Milky Tops. Obviously, their colour depends on how long they're kept in the solution; getting consistent colours is extremely difficult if you're only doing small batches at a time.  

This method also works for dyeing white POM switch stems, why you’d want to do that, I do not know ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ .
