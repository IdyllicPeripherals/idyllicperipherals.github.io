## Flowering Purple and Green Acrylic Cases 

In mid 2021, I was able to sell a small batch of acrylic cases on the Keyboard Treehouse. There was a nice distribution of international and local support. 

What made my cases different to not only other Prime-E designs, but other acrylic cases on the market, is the usage of O-rings and a thin bottom-mounted Polypropylene plate. 

The Primrose has a very soft and bouncy typing experience which is the opposite of the expected sandwich-mount keyboards. 

Heading into 2022, I may produce Primrose cases again depending on whether or not I am able to source more Prime E PCBs.
