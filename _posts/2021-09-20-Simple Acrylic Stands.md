## Offering an Alternative Stand Design with Focuses on Value 

Simple Stands are a product I produced after the launch of my Designer Stands. I didnâ€™t want to pressure people into buying a lesser cost-effective product if the customer is simply after a product with value lying in utility. I understand some people just want a simple stand to display their keyboards. 

Idyllic Simple Stands use 3 pieces of 3mm of acrylic on both sides of an anodised standoff; there are numerous rubber adhesive padding to prevent scratches from happening on displayed keyboards.
