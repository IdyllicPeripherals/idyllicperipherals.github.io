###  Getting the Right Sized Sheet of Acrylic

First, I start with a whole sheet of acrylic and cut it down to size. The dimensions of the newly cut sheet will depend on what is being made. 

In this scenario, I need a sheet that is 22cm (H) X 60cm (L).

###  Cutting the Designs

My Designer Stands have four different files that need to be cut. Depending on the colourway, I might need up to four different coloured sheets of material. 

In this example I need three different pieces of material:
* Right and Left Side Pieces - Matte Black
* Top Base Piece - Mirror Blue
* Bottom Base Piece - Gloss Black

### Assembling the Base Piece

For all the Stands I sell, I assemble the base pieces to make life easier for the end-user. 

Admittedly , it is time consuming because there are several steps required:
1. Peel off the protective film  
2. Align pieces in the correct orientation 
3. Install 8x M3 Screws into the acrylic

### Packing the Hardware

Quite a bit of hardware needs to be arranged; I usually do this while the Laser Machine is running.

Packing and Counting:
* Adhesive Rubber Padding  - Pack of Ten 
* M4 Screws - Pack of Four
* M4 Nylon Standoff - Pack of Four
* M6 Screws - Pack of Four
* M6 Standoffs - Pack of Two

	<img src="/images/Photo_Blog/Idyllic_Stand_Process_25.jpg">
	<img src="/images/Photo_Blog/Idyllic_Stand_Process_26.jpg">
 </div>

Once all the parts have been arranged, I finally get to wrap and pack everything together. 

In the future, I aim to have correctly sized boxes to package my Stands into. Currently, the total package weighs roughly 400g.
