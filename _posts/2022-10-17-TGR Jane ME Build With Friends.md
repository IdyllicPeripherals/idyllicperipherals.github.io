## Background

On Wednesday the 28th of September, I was fortunate enough to find an invoice for the TGR Jane V2 ME in my inbox. This wasnâ€™t something I needed to have, but how can I turn-down the opportunity to own a keyboard boasting the TGR name.

Monokeiâ€™s service was great and the keyboard arrived to me on October the 10th after being in transit with DHL for 4 business days.

At this point, I didnâ€™t have anything in-mind for the keyboard and was too busy with other things to make time for building. When it arrived, the initial decision was to let it rest in the Kaban for a while longer.

Coincidently, around this time, EPBT Simple Ja R2 had completed production, and my IRL friend was excited to finally get her first GB keyset after waiting >1.5 years. Unfortunately, being relatively normal, she doesnâ€™t own an array of keyboards, and therefore didnâ€™t really have anything to put the keycaps on. 

Curious to see the quality of the EPBT dye-sub, I offered to let her build and borrow the TGR Jane ME so she had something to put Simple Ja on.

With University concluding and the end of year approaching, the odd hours of a Monday was chosen to build the keyboard â€” Friend A and Friend B arrived with my Bubble Tea order at around 8:30pm. 

The Build Plan:
* TGR Jane V2 ME â€“ Silver
* Brass Plate
* All Clacks â€“ Stock (Didn't have time to prepare anything better)
* TX Stabilisers â€“ MCG 129 Lube
* EPBT Simple Ja R2

Building a keyboard is relatively simple; whatâ€™s the worse that could happen? 

Though our team could be described as "somewhat-unorthodox", I wasnâ€™t too worried and put full faith in their building skills.

### Switches:
Deciding on switches. All Clacks, SP Star Momos or TTC Golden Browns?

Not the best range... But this is all I had on-hand.

### Installing the Switches:

Since this is a Hotswap PCB, I recommended putting switches into the plate all at once, and just lowering into the PCB.

How do people struggle with Switches, Plates and PCbs. 

No skill issues here Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

### Opening Up the Jane V2:

Trying to remove the backplate was actually pretty troublesome; the tool, being made from plastic, was relatively soft and easily deformed. The magnets were too strong, and it was very difficult to generate enough force to leverage the backplate upwards.

Soooo, I fugged up and didnâ€™t check thoroughly enoughâ€¦ The enter stabiliser had an issue and we needed to take it all apart to re-do.


### Existence is Suffering:

When taking the board apart, we found out that the All Clacks stems really liked the EPBT keycaps and didnâ€™t want to leave ðŸ˜Š. 

This meant that we didnâ€™t have enough switches to put back into the keyboard. 
<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
<img src="/images/Photo_Blog/Jane/DSC_1363.jpg">
</div>

I had to use a small drill bit and tweezers to remove the broken stems out of about 10 keycaps. 

If the switches were to have broken-off when she returned the board, that would have been easier to manage. I wasnâ€™t planning on needing to take the keycaps off so soon.


### Finishing Up - Again:

Since we didn't have enough All Clacks to replace the broken ones, SP Star Momos were used to fill the gaps.

We also decided to lube the stems to make removing keycaps easier in the future.

### All Done:

We ended finished up by around 12:30PM. 

Easy speedrun.

The board worked fine and had no issues when we tested it in VIA.

Friend A and Friend B were actually really quick at typing and reached >100 WPM on Monkey Type.
