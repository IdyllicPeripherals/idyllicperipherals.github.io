### Aesthetics
{% comment %}**_How often will someone be looking at the side profile of the stand, shouldn’t focus be on the two beautiful keyboards on display?_** {% endcomment %}

Initially, I wanted my design to be a simple shape, flat without any “points or peaks”. However, for this design to happen, the second ledge cannot be lower than where the first ledge ends. 

While this isn’t necessarily a problem, it leads to some future predicaments for both me as the producer, and the customer as the end-user. Ultimately, I decided to completely re-evaluate my approach and abandon the idea of a simple shaped Double Stand. 

I’m aware some people detest the visuals of a dual stand which hides the second keyboard behind the first, however I feel visuals are worth sacrificing for the sake of practicality.

### Practicality
{% comment %}**_What value does a double stand provide, that two singular stands do not?_**{% endcomment %}

A current advantage of my design is the small form-factor; people can now keep two keyboards in a space which would normally only fit one. I believe that it is important to consider the end-user's use-case and I should try to accommodate their needs where possible. While there isn't a standard size for a shelf, by keeping my design small, I open up more opportunities for spaces which can fit my Double Stand. The Double Stand has a depth of 20cm, which is as compact as I could get without too many compromises.

{% comment %}**_What's the value of a display piece that can't actually fit in the area you want to display it?_**{% endcomment %}

After a trip to IKEA, the book shelves I’ve measured are between 20cm and 30cm in depth. For additional reference, a vertical A4 sheet of paper is 21cm in width; I think it’s reasonable to say ~21cm is a good reference point to use for the depth of shelf. 

If I’m displaying two of my beloved keyboards on a shelf, an overhanging keyboard stand is not an option. The stand needs to be smaller than the shelf; I do not want to risk any accidental bumps or knocks.

### Affordability

For better or worse, I’m blessed with a pretty good Standard of Living here in Australia. Unfortunately, that also means the price of my goods will reflect that; given I am the one producing and packaging all in-house. 

Pricing involves multiple factors; however in its simplest, machine-processing time, material cost, and labour are major influencers. 

A few advantages my current design has, as opposed to a larger design are:

* Faster processing times on the laser machine 
* Uses less materials -> Less surface area -> Efficient nesting options
* Easier and quicker to handle + pack

The points above are extremely desirable because it means I can offer a “more affordable” product to the customer.

I’ve tried my best to optimize wherever possible because I understand some customers are simply after "X item to serve Y purpose at a low cost".
