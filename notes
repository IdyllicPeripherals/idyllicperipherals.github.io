Storage Container
An easy to open, easy to close, way to store all your tools. A container like this is a great way to stay organised while also keeping the dust, fibers and pet hair out. 

Switch Opener 
The Switch Opener will work with both MX and Wing-latch style switches.
Position the switch correctly, before gently pushing downwards. 

Silicone Oil - 1000cst
This locally-produced oil is for lubing the springs of your switches. Some prefer brushing it on directly, however, others also find it perfect for bag lubing. 
The thickness and high viscosity of this oil helps it stick to surfaces longer and does a better job at removing spring "ping" and "crunch" than thinner alternatives.  

Triangular Brush 
Please wash and rinse the bristles of all brushes before use. 
Comfortable handle, slightly larger in size and has a bit more weight than the straight brushes. 
It's shape helps stop it from rolling away and it comes with useful little cap to protect the bristles from dust and damage when not in use.  

Stem Holder
A tool like this is perfect for holding switch Stem and makes lubing them so much easier. Press and hold the top open the clutch; release to grip. 
You no longer need to fear accidently dropping and searching for those loose stems.  
Dustproof and Regular MX Style are both compatiable with this Stem Holder. 

Puller 2-in-1 
Use gentle a side to side motion when pulling off keycaps. This minimises potential damage to the underside of the plastic. 
The metal prongs are designer to make it easier for you to pull switches out of plates. Press and squeese the North and South of the switch, then pull upwards. 
You may need to also wiggle the East and West of the switch.
