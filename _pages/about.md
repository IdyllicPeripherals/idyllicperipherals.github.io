## Hello!

My name is Tommy and I’m currently located in Brisbane, Australia.

I’ve been in the Mechanical Keyboard scene since 2016 and have recently completed a Bachelor's Degree in IT, as well as a Graduate Certificate in Project Management.

I’m not too social and usually keep to myself; the [Australian Keyboard Discord](https://discord.gg/kDVErE7xHk){:target="_blank"} is probably where I am most active. 

My current focus in 2022 is to produce more keyboard goods locally using Australian infrastructure. I don’t really expect to produce many things, but I’m curious to see how willing local businesses are to work with hobbyists. 

I currently run Mechstock as well as provide goods to multiple vendors in Australia.
