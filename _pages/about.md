## Hello!

My name is Tommy and I’m currently located in Brisbane, Australia.

I’ve been in the Mechanical Keyboard scene since 2016 and have recently completed a Bachelor's Degree in IT, as well as a Graduate Certificate in Project Management.

At the moment, I am studying to get a CCNA Networking Certificate so I can begin a career in IT. 

I currently run Mechstock as well as providing goods to multiple vendors in Australia.
