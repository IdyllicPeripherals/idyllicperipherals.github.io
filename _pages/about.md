## Hello!

My name is Tommy and I’m currently located in Brisbane, Australia.

I’ve been in the Mechanical Keyboard scene since 2016 and have recently completed a Bachelor's Degree in IT, as well as a Graduate Certificate in Project Management.

I began making Youtube Content after I was disappointed by the lack of ideas and principles being taught to impressionable newcomers. Majority of the current content creators don't encourage thinking, instead aim to display subjective experiences as objective fact for the sake of entertainment.

I’m not too social and usually keep to myself; the [Australian Keyboard Discord](https://discord.gg/kDVErE7xHk){:target="_blank"} is probably where I am most active. 

My current focus in 2022 is to produce more keyboard goods locally, using Australian infrastructure. I don’t really expect to get many things produced, but I’m curious to see how willing local businesses are to work with hobbyists. 

I currently run Mechstock as well as provide goods to multiple vendors in Australia.
