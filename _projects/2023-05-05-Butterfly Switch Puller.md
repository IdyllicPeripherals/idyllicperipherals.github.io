### The Design ###
This is a premium keycap puller, but for simplicity and the sake of airport-customs, it is also called a **“High Precision Specialised Wire Tool with Elongated Handles.”** There is no blade, and this is not a weapon; this accessory is a wire-tool used for removing keycaps off Computer Keyboards. The folding handle design allows for improved safe-keeping and minimises the risk of accidental damage to the wires.

### When will it be purchaseable? ###
I plan to release the first batch of pullers in August, 2023. This timeline lines up with the Melbourne keyboard meetup and I would like to have some display units to show on the day. 
If the design is popular enough, I’ll consider in-stock drops every 2-3 months with different colourways each time. When I get bored and want to sell-out, I’ll make weeb edition pullers with anime waifus or something.

When it comes to expensive goods, a customer needs to believe that a product is a worthwhile purchase and can be justified; since value is subjective this hard to measure and really quantify. There are so many variables, both tangible and intangible to consider.

The value of a keycap puller is in its ability to remove keycaps; this is the sole purpose of the tool. Such a simple function can be achieved by something as inexpensive as leftover paperclips or if you’re a bit fancier, 50c, mass-produced, injection molded pullers. 

There are a few things that can be done to make the user-experience better and current custom pullers do have some nice physical features to their designs. Usually, the handles are enlarged and shaped out of Wood, Plastic or Metal to provide users with better grip. Most times, however, the wire remains unchanged and is the standard silver stainless steel.

In terms of intangible value, brand recognition is always a powerful advertising and sales tool, however, unfortunately, since I’m a small, no-name maker, this isn’t a realistic method I can rely on to guarantee purchases.  

After many months of passive, shower thoughts, I concluded that my design needs to focus on aesthetics while also adding a sprinkle of some outlandishness; my keycap pullers need to be beautiful, innovative and provide value in terms of novelty.

Resin, anodised metals, Cerakote, sparkles, glitters and gold are great for visuals and social media posts, but at the end of the day, most fancy keycap pullers just get put aside and are only taken-out when keycaps need removing; this makes them no different to any other puller tool. 

Is there a way I can create a Keycap puller that has some potential value even when keycaps don’t need removing?

### Milestones ###

**18-4-2023**
- Learning Fusion 360 [Zero prior 3D CAD experience]
- Researching Balisong designs [Squid Industries, ect on Instagram/Reddit]
- Planning hardware and components needed
- Rough project roadmap and cost approximation for feasibility analysis 

**1-5-2023**
- Finish Rev 1 Design

**5-5-2023**
- Searching Alibaba for manufacturers 
* Blade and Wires [Enquiries for Quotations]
* Handles [Enquiries for Quotations]

((Finding a place that would produce Blade and Wires as one unit to reduce the components I need to order))

**7-5-2023**
- Order placed for Handles at a familiar CNC factory #1
* Handles [Minimum MOQ of 10x Handles purchased] [6x Black and 4x Raw]

((I probably could have refined my design before ordering a prototype, but I really wanted to receive a 3D part))

**1-6-2023**
- Handles shipped via Sea Freight with other Mechstock.com goods

((I wanted to have the handles sent earlier so I could evaluate, but there was a shipping delay due to other my other project's factory...))

**5-6-2023**
- Started R2 Design - learning more Fusion360 [Lofts and Surfacing Techniques]__*__
- More Research and Development [Moving away from Stainless Steel Wires to a more premium material]__**__
- Re-designed Wire Shape [More rounded design to match the roundness of R2 Handles]

__*__((I felt like the handle design could be more refined and prettier. Grew impatient of waiting for R1 samples. Need to act fast)) 

__**__((Stainless Steel Wires are hard to colour and deform too easily)) ((Find out that the new wire is 10x as expensive as SS wires...))
((I knew that I would find a better option than SS, so I didn't bother ordering wires at the same time as the handles))


**15-6-2023**
- Finished Rev 2 Design and ordering parts round 2
* Blade [Order Placed] [25x Silver and 25x Black units from familiar CNC factory #2]
* Handles [Pending Order Placement] [10x units or 50 units]__*__
* Wires [Pending Order Placement] [50x Black and 50x Silver Nitinol Wires]
* Hardware [Pending Quote]
* Boxes [Order Placed] [20x Black, 20x White, 10x Light Blue]

__*__((hmmm deciding colours to order from "Premium Factory"))
