I am fortunate enough to have been given the opportunity to help Daily Clack produce a keyboard starter pack for newcomers to the hobby. 

By having some essential tools all in one place, people can now spend less time searching for where to source the simple staples they need.  

---

**The Beginner Tool Bundle Includes:** 
* Plastic Storage Container
* DC Anodized Switch Opener
* 5ml Silicone Oil - 1000cst
* Straight Brushes
* Triangle Brush
* 2-in-1 - Puller
* Stem Holder
* 1ml Syringe
* Tweezer

### Storage Container
An easy to open, easy to close, way to store all your tools. 
A container like this is a great way to stay organized while also keeping the dust and pet hair out.

### Switch Opener
The Switch Opener will work with both MX and Wing-latch style switches.

Position the switch correctly, before gently pushing downwards.

### Silicone Oil - 1000cst
This low-cost oil is for lubing the springs of your switches. 
Some prefer brushing it on directly, however, it is also perfect for bag lubing. 

Use a generous amount to make sure the spring is coated completely.

The thickness and high viscosity of this oil helps it stick to surfaces longer and does a better job at removing spring "ping" and "crunch" than thinner alternatives. 

Admittedly, this isn't a tool; I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to include something so suitable. 

The oil was sourced from Flexichem in South Australia, they are a family owned chemical manufacturer which specialises in silicone products.

### 2-in-1 Puller
**Keycap Puller**
Use a gentle side to side motion when pulling off keycaps. This minimizes potential damage to the underside of the plastic. 

**Switch Puller** 
The metal prongs are designed to make it easier for you to pull switches out of plates. Press and squeeze the North and South of the switch, then pull upwards. 
You may need to also wiggle the East and West of the switch.

### Tweezer
These Tweezers are an essential tool to help pick up and hold smaller sized pieces. 

Some examples are:
* Films
* Springs
* Switch Housing

</div>

Some other examples of use-cases are:
* Straightening crumpled switch pins
* Bridging traces and testing a PCB's matrix

### Triangular Brush
This brush has a comfortable handle and is slightly larger in size than the straight brushes. 

The shape also helps prevent it from rolling away when placed on a table. All brushes come with a useful little cap to protect the bristles from collecting dust when not in use.  

<div class="gallery" data-columns="2">

</div>

The bristles of these brushes perfectly match your switch stems and housing rails.

	<img src="/images/Photo_Blog/Brush_4.jpg">
</div>

We've given you three brushes so you can allocate different ones for different uses. 

Examples: 
* Oils - Dielectric Grease - Krytox
* Stabs - Springs - Switch Housing
* Ect - Ect - Ect

**Please wash and rinse the bristles of all the brushes before use.**

### Stem Holder
A tool like this is perfect for holding switch stems and makes lubing them so much easier. Press and hold to open the clutch; release to grip. 

You no longer need to fear finger cramps!

</div>
Dustproof and regular MX Style are both compatible with this Stem Holder. 

---

### Syringe 
This Syringe has a capacity of 1mL. Realistically, you won't ever need to fill it up completely.

Please note that this Luer Slip styled tip is slightly wider than metal dispensing tips; it won't be suitable for filling hard to reach places. 
Nonetheless, it can make injecting thicker greases like Dielectric or Krytox XHT-BDZ a lot easier.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="2">
	<img src="/images/Photo_Blog/Syringe.jpg">
	<img src="/images/Photo_Blog/Syringe_2.jpg"> 
</div>

There are many ways to use this syringe; find what works for you.

Examples: 
* Applying small, controlled amounts of Krytox Lube directly onto your brush 
* Injecting	 Lube into stabiliser parts
