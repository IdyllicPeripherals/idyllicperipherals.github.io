###*Milestones###

**18-4-2023**
- Learning Fusion 360 [0 Prior Experience]
- Researching Balisong Designs [Squid Industries and other makers on Instagram/Reddit]
- Planning hardware and components needed
- Rough project roadmap and cost approximation for feasibility analysis 

**1-5-2023**
Finish Rev 1 Design

**5-5-2023**
- Searching Alibaba for manufacturers 
* Blade and Wires [Enquiries for Quotations]
* Handles [Enquiries for Quotations]
((Finding a place the would produce Blade and Wires as one unit to reduce the components I need to order))

**7-5-2023**
Order placed for Handles at a familiar CNC factory
* Handles [Minimum MOQ of 10x Handles purchased] [6x Black and 4x Raw]
((I probably could have refined my design before ordering a prototype, but I really wanted to receive a 3D part))

**1-6-2023**
Handles Shipped via Sea Freight with other Mechstock.com goods
((I wanted to have the handles sent earlier so I could evaluate, but there was a shipping delay due to other my other project's factory...))

**5-6-2023**
- Started R2 Design - more Fusion360 learning [Lofts and Surfacing Techniques]
((I felt like the handle design could be more refined and prettier. Grew impatient of waiting)) 
- More Reasearch and Development [Moving away from Stainless Steel Wires to a more premium material]
((Stainless Steel Wires are hard to colour and deform too easily)) ((Find out that the New wire is 10x as expensive as SS wires...))
((Knew I would find a better option than SS, so I didn't bother order at the same time as the handles. 

**15-6-2023**
Finished Rev 2 Design Ordering Parts Round 2
* Blade [Order Placed]
* Handles [Pending Order Placement]
* Wires [Pending Order Placement]
* Hardware [Pending Quote]
* Boxes [Order Placed]
