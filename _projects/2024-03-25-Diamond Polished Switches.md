### Why do I Diamond Polish and Keep Switches Mated? ###
Diamond paste is so effective at making switches smooth that results can be noticed after only a few thousand actuations, whereas breaking-in may require more than one million actuations to even start removing scratch.
Overall, using a paste provides more consistent and much smoother results than broken in switches. 

Additionally, to produce the smoothest switches, the housing and stem are kept together during the cleaning process. This is important because surfaces begin with different levels of microscopic imperfections. During the Actuation period, the stem leg and leaf will "flatten" at a uniform rate with one-another, becoming a mated surface. 

Keeping parts paired up adds more complexity to the cleaning process and does take more time than if parts were mixed, however, I think the effort is worth it and leads to better and more consistent switches.

Above is the setup I use to keep all the parts organised. Switch Tops, Stems and Bottom Housing can easily be paired back together during assembly using these tools.

Since 1.5mm Acrylic is commonly only found in Clear colour, I had to engraved text to each Bottom-Housing holder. This makes it obvious and easy to match bottoms with the stems in the 3mm acrylic.
